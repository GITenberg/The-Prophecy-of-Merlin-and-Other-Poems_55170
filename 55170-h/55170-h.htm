<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sir Bedivere, in silence, watched the barge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bore away King Arthur to the vale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Avalon, till it was seen no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, on the beach, alone amid the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lifted up his voice and sorely wept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Alas!” he cried, “gone are the pleasant days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Camelot, and the sweet fellowship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of noble knights and true, and beauteous dames<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who have no peers in all the living world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is quite dissolved for ever, and the King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has gone and left none like him among men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O happy, thrice and fourfold, ye who rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both friends and foemen, in one peaceful bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I am sick at soul and cannot die!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! that the battle might be fought again!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then would I surely seek the way to death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a>{4}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bleed and sleep like you, and be at peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, ah! whither, whither can I go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since he is gone who was my light of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whom to see was bliss? What can I do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without the voice that gave my arm its strength?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or wherefore bear a sword, since now no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Excalibur points forth to noble deeds?”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And then he drew his blade, and threw it far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the Lake, and, as he saw it sink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Would God,” said he, “that so I followed him.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But with the strain his wounds began to bleed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he grew weak, and sank upon the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swooned.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And when he woke, he was aware<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Merlin, who stood watching by his side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then cried Sir Bedivere: “O good and wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bid thee welcome, for, in all the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is none other I would fainer see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet am I sad to see thee, for the King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is gone, and none is left of all his Knights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save me, and I am weary of my life.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a>{5}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But Merlin, ere he answered, staunched his wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave him wine out of a golden flask,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, by the healing art which he possessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restored him sound and whole. And then he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“There is no need to tell me, for I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All thou would’st say, and knew ere thou wast born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all these things should be. But weep no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir Bedivere. The past no man can change,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor make what has been other than it is.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in the forests of Broceliande,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The leaves fall year by year, and give the oaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All bare to wintry blasts, so, swept apace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the breath of Time, the race of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passes away, and may be seen no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet the breeze of Spring is no less sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which plays around the tender budding leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And calls to life their beauty, that it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well a requiem as baby-song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So weep not for the days that are no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But pray, as the King bade thee, for his soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That to his far-off home no sigh may come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From this, his orphan and unhappy realm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mar the melody of Avalon.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a>{6}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then said Sir Bedivere: “O good and wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will he return again to Camelot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After his wound is healed, and Guinevere<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Is that which is to be in after days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For even now I scarce can comprehend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What thou hast spoken with prophetic lips.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These things are very far beyond my reach.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This only do I know, that I am now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An orphan knight, reft of the royal sire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That made me knight, giving my soul new birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heirdom to the Christian fellowship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Round Table. Gladly would I give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All glory ever won by knightly deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All honour in the ranks of my compeers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a>{25}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">All gentle blandishments of ladies fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that I am, or have, or prize the most,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sink into the meanness of the churl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That feeds the Saxon’s swine, for but one glimpse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my loved lord, King Arthur. But I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he will never more to Camelot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring back the glory of his vanished face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor call me his ‘true knight, Sir Bedivere.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I will pray, even as thou badst me pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as King Arthur bade me, for his soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That to his far-off home no sigh may come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From this his orphan and unhappy realm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mar the melody of Avalon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though he may not hither come to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May I not hope that I may go to him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see him face to face, in that fair land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose beauty mortal eye has never seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose music mortal ear has never heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose glory mortal heart has not conceived.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But, Merlin, I would ask thee one thing more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou have patience with my blunter sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For I am but a knight, and thou, a sage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a>{26}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knowest all things)&mdash;prithee, tell me, Merlin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, in the far-off after-time, shall come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Prince who shall be known by Arthur’s name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bear it blamelessly as he did his.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Then, Merlin, with a wise smile on his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as a mother wears who gently tries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To answer the hard question of her child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answered Sir Bedivere: “Thou askest well,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On Britain’s future Kings, and they shall learn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not only from her lips, but from her life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That who rules well must make Christ’s law his rule.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of the Good Queen and the Blameless Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_027" id="page_027"></a>{27}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">One son shall be named Arthur. Like the King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whom thy heart is sad, Sir Bedivere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shall be true, and brave, and generous<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In speech and act to all of all degrees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And win the unsought guerdon of men’s love.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Then, by the memories of his lord, the King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir Bedivere was quickened into tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, like a boy ashamed to shew wet eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before a boy, he passed his mailéd hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Athwart his face, and frightened back his grief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seeing Merlin made no sign to speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More of the Arthur of the after-time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_028" id="page_028"></a>{28}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took the word: “Thanks, Merlin, thou art kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the limit of my gratitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fear me. Sorrow is a selfish thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And much exacts from friendship. Still, I thank thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou hast not gainsayed my utmost quest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, now, I pray God bless him when he comes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That other Arthur. May he keep his name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As pure as his who ruled in Camelot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May he, in every wise, be like to him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save in the pain that comes of love deceived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trampled faith; and may his far-off land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be great by noble deeds of noble men.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Then came a sound of music from the Lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Like the soft sighing of the summer winds<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Among the pine-trees, and Sir Bedivere<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Turned toward the sound. But as he turned again<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To ask of Merlin what the music meant,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Merlin was gone, and he was all alone&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Alone upon the beach amid the dead!<br /></span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While sleep had set its seal on many eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balaam, the Seer, was forth beneath the stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose beauty glimmered in Euphrates’ stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gemming the mournful willows’ floating hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind him were the mountains of the east,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dark-browed nurses of the blue-eyed founts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose lone hearts were the life of Pethor-land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Westward, beyond the river, was the waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er which, this second time, with priceless gifts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had come from Balak noble messengers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And westward were the eyes of Balaam turned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one who waits for one who does not come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While wild things came and passed unheeded by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the night wind, as with an angel’s harp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Played lullaby to all the dreaming flowers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, gazing on the western sky, he saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A picture, all whose forms were quick with life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where all was discord, hurrying to and fro,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_060" id="page_060"></a>{60}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when two armies strive to gain the field;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, from the outer realms of space, there came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gigantic spearsmen, over whom there waved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gay, many-coloured banners, and these flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hither and thither, o’er the starry plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursuing and retreating; others came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And others, till it seemed all Sabaoth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had joined in conflict with the wicked one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then there was a change; banners and spears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faded away, as fades away the reek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above a hamlet on a frosty morn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none can tell when he sees last of it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in a little while, there grew an arch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose keystone was the zenith of the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like to a rainbow, joining east and west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beautiful, quivering, fearful, ominous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawing the heart of Balaam after it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this, too, vanished, vapor-like, away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Balaam, though he waited its return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waited in vain; for warriors, and spears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And banners, and the fiery flash of hosts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embattled, and the mystic arch, were gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And came no more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_061" id="page_061"></a>{61}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Balaam stood amazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long time, while thoughts, conflicting, tore his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And barred all passage for his voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">At length,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Hath not the Highest, by this sign, declared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His purpose? <span class="smcap">I must go!</span>” he said, and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark-boding terrors shook him and the strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That held his face rapt westward, all relaxed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By speech, he felt as one, who, in a dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stands on a steep cliff, by the greedy sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While ruthless foes pursue him.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">“<span class="smcap">I must go!</span>”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and from ten thousand horrid throats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There seemed to come a mocking answer, “Go!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o’er him came a shiver, as a lake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shivers beneath the burden of a breeze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then there came a whisper to his ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Balaam, God’s prophet! go not with these men!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Puttest thou Balak’s honour above His<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who chose thee to declare His will to men?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go, and thou art undone! God doth not lie!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Balaam, as in answer to a friend:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“There came across the desert lordly men<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_062" id="page_062"></a>{62}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Moab and from Midian, who besought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many prayers and noble gifts, that I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balaam, the Seer, would go with them and curse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A people who were terrible in war&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom the strength of Moab was as grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the oxen, feeding on the plains&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, haply, I might crush them with a curse!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These prayed I to abide with me all night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I should learn the purpose of the Lord&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in a dream, God warned me not to go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so they went away ungratified.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came these princes with more precious gifts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still more precious promises, who said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Balak, our lord, hath sent us unto thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prayeth thee to come. He will promote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee and thy house to honour; and all boons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whate’er thou askest, he will freely give.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I replied, ‘If Balak’s house were full<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gold and silver, and he made it mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or more or less than God commandeth me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not do. But tarry here to-night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will hear the answer of the Lord.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then God sent a sign, the like of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_063" id="page_063"></a>{63}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, who know all the faces of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And am familiar with all stars that shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the hills and plains of Pethor-land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have never seen before, a sign which said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Balaam, if these men call thee, rise and go.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or more or less than God commandeth me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot do. Am I in this to blame?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the wind came sweeping down the hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Balaam heard again the mocking cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“If these man call thee, Balaam, rise and go.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though he shuddered, all his face grew dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knotted, as he said, “God doth not lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But&mdash;doth God mock? Hath he not sent a sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me, who have the power of reading signs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His own high gift? And now&mdash;and now, O God!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou wouldst send me yet another sign&mdash;!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here the whisper of the still, small voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came back, “O, Balaam! wretched is their fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, knowing good from evil, choose not good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or suffer evil, howsoever fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make the good less lovely in their eyes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full well thou knowest that thy heart is set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More on the gold of Balak than God’s will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a>{64}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">God doth not mock. ’Tis thou that mockest Him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coming into His presence, full of lust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seeking for a sign. If thou wert pure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sign were needed. Being as thou art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wert thou to offer up the land’s whole wealth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oxen and rams, and corn, and wine, and oil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the first-born of thy kings, no sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would purge thee of those sordid dreams that drag<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy soul from God to hell!<br /></span>
<span class="i10">It is not yet too late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps, and but perhaps!<br /></span>
<span class="i10">O, Balaam, rouse thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art, e’en yet, God’s prophet! He has shewn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His will to none more clearly than to thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is it He requireth at thy hands?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be true and honest, pure and merciful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Having thy heart aflame with faith and love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still walking humbly, as though prone to fall&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guarding thine eyes from covetous wanderings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deeming God’s gifts more beautiful than man’s&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he will keep thee right in all thy ways.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! what is Balak’s honour, Balak’s gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Balaam, if the Highest be his friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_065" id="page_065"></a>{65}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who owns the wealth and beauty of the world?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balaam, if these men call thee, do not go.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Balaam bowed himself unto the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lay upon his face in misery;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his heart an awful battle raged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where evil fought with good. Longtime he lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one entranced, all motionless, but full,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through every nerve, of wakeful, painful life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he rose, as from his grave, so pale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wild his visage; and he looked again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the waste, towards the western sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But saw no sign, save that the stars grew dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some were gone; and, even as he looked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seemed to hear from all the waking earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne through the gloaming on the mountain wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The words he loved and longed for and yet loathed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Balaam, if these men call thee, rise and go.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And once again a shudder shook his frame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once again he bowed him to the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lay upon his face in misery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until, from weariness, he fell asleep.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And as he slept, he dreamed he was a child<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_066" id="page_066"></a>{66}</span><br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then there came a noble, swelling strain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And was a man, with men&mdash;a king of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With crown of inspiration on his brow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around him thronged the chiefs of Pethor-land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And others, from afar, who came to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wisdom God had given to his lips.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he was still as humble as the child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That played of yore amid the flowers, and drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From their sweet breath the beauty of the good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he spoke, they listened to his words<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then came a discord, as a sound of waves<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Proud with the pride of vain and worldly men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought within his heart how great he was,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And all the earth looked pure as when it rose,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The first sensations of his infancy<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The tempest’s rage, to which the pine and oak<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The rain, the whirlwind and the thundercrash,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountain torrent, “the vexed ocean’s roar,”&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noisy lapping of the tongues of fire,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The howl of hungry, ravenous beasts of prey,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that is sad or mad in Nature’s voice,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that reminds us of the awful words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pierced the fancied hiding place of sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere yet the curse descended,&mdash;these he knew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, in those giant days before the Flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature and man were ever face to face,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And made enquiry of the household maids:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Come now, handmaidens, answer me in truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whither white-armed Andromache has gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek my sisters, or my brothers’ wives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_182" id="page_182"></a>{182}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to Athene’s temple, where a crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of matrons seek the bright-haired goddess’ wrath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To turn to mercy by the strength of tears?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A trusty servant quickly made response:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Hector, my lord, right willingly my lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall answer truthfully thy eager quest,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to thy sisters, nor thy brothers’ wives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor to Athene’s temple, where a crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of matrons seek the bright haired goddess’ wrath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To turn to mercy by the strength of tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has gone Andromache; but she has gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto a lofty tower of Ilion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To watch the contest, for bad tidings came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Greeks victorious and of Trojans slain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at this moment, like a frenzied one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She rushes to the rampart, while, behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her darling boy is carried by his nurse.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She ceased; nor waited Hector long, but rushed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the house, along the very way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he had come, through fair-built Troja’s streets;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor paused he till he reached the Scæan gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Through which he meant to hie him to the plain).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_183" id="page_183"></a>{183}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here Andromache of queenly dower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wife, the daughter of Eëtion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who dwelt erstwhile ’neath Placus’ woody height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Thebe, ruling o’er Cilician men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came running till she met him in the way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her, the nurse, who to her bosom held<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An innocent-hearted babe, their only son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His father’s joy, in beauty like a star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scamandrius named by Hector, but the host<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called him Astyanax, the City’s King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honouring Hector chief defence of Troy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now he looked on him, and smiled a smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That spake his heart more than a thousand words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called the tears into his mother’s eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, clinging to her husband, grasped his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, sobbing “Hector,” spoke to him these words:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No sire have I, nor gentle mother left,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Him</i>, as thou know’st, the proud Achilles slew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And razed his fair-built city to the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High-gated Thebe. Yet he spoiled him not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although he slew him, but, with reverence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid him in glittering arms upon the pyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raised a mound in honour of his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which the hill-nymphs garlanded round with elms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The daughters of the ægis-bearing Zeus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my seven brothers, in one fatal day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entered the gloomy shades where Pluto reigns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slain by the ruthless hand that slew my sire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, in their native fields, they watched the herds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of kine, slow-footed, and of snowy sheep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did my queenly mother long survive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, led a captive to the Grecian camp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With other spoils, the victor sent her home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For goodly ransom, only to be slain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the sure shaft of huntress Artemis.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou art father, mother, brother, spouse,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Stay here and watch with me upon this tower,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stay, stay, my Hector, go not hence to make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy child an orphan and a widow me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But set the forces by the Fig-tree Hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the chief risk of hostile entrance lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the wall is weakest. At that point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already have the bravest of our foes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Idomeneus and either Ajax, Diomede,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the two sons of Atreus&mdash;made assault,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether incited thither by some voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prophetic, or high hope of victory.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So stay, my Hector, they will need thee here.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then valiant Hector, of quick-glancing helm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus made reply: “Of all that thou hast said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My own true wife, I feel, I know the truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But&mdash;could I bear the taunts of Trojan chiefs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stately Trojan dames, if, coward-like,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I skulked from battle in my country’s need?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor does my spirit keep me from the fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I have learned, brave-hearted, ’mid the first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To draw my sword in Ilion’s defence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To struggle for the honour of my sire<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_186" id="page_186"></a>{186}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for my own. Although too well I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day shall come when sacred Troy must fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Priam and his war-like hosts, who well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can wield in fight the ashen-handled spear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not the woes of my brave countrymen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet my mother’s nor my kingly sire’s,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor all my brethren’s who shall bite the dust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Neath bitter foes, touch me so much as thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When some one of the brass-mailed Greeks shall end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy days of freedom, leading thee away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In tears; and, haply, in far Argos, thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May’st tend another’s loom or water draw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Hyperea’s or Messeis’ fount,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A slavish duty forced on thee by fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some one, looking on thy tears, may say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘<i>She</i> was the wife of Hector, who excelled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fight among the chiefs that fought for Troy.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy poor heart will ache with vain regret<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From looking on thy sorrow and disgrace!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So spake the noble Hector, and his arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_187" id="page_187"></a>{187}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extended to receive his son; but <i>he</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrank, crying, to his well-robed nurse’s breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearing the war-like presence of his sire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His brazen armour and the horse-hair crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above his helmet nodding fearfully.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hector took the helmet off his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laid it down, all gleaming, on the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he kissed and dandled him, and prayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Zeus and all the gods on his behalf:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O Zeus and all ye gods, I pray you, grant<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From war: ‘He’s braver than his father was.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May he from war-like men take gory spoils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And may his mother glory in his might!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such was the warrior’s prayer; and in the arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his dear wife he placed the little child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She clasped the treasure to her fragrant breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tearfully smiling. And her husband’s soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was touched with pity, and he nursed her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called her by her name: “Andromache,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_188" id="page_188"></a>{188}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My love, fret not thyself too much for me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No man descends to Hades ere his time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none whoe’er is born escapes his fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether his heart be cowardly or brave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, love, returning home, apply thyself<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And of all men that have been born in Troy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This war has need of none so much as me.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus having spoken, noble Hector placed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waving helmet on his head again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, silently, Andromache returned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Oft looking back through her fast-gushing tears)<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<br /><br />(<i>Homer’s Iliad</i> xxii. 437-515.)</h4>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But she whom he had loved, Andromache,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knew not of Hector’s death, for none had come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell her of his stay without the walls.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">She in the lofty palace sat retired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within her chamber, working at the loom,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weaving a purple vest, with varied flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embroidered.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">But, as she her fair-haired maids<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enjoined to place upon the blazing fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spacious caldron, that the soothing bath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might be for Hector ready when he came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home from the battle, knowing not that he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betrayed by blue-eyed Pallas, bleeding lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath Achilles’ hand, she heard the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of weeping and of wailing on the walls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her limbs trembled, and the shuttle fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Then cried she to her maids:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Come, quickly, follow me, that we may see<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My mother’s voice. My heart within my breast<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And&mdash;oh! I dread some ill to Priam’s house.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, me! I fear me much, great Peleus’ son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has severed my brave Hector from the town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drives him to the plain; and soon his life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will be the forfeit of his manly rage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never would he abide amid the crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But must be ever foremost in the war,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In valour without peer.”<br /></span>
<span class="i8">She said, and flew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the palace, like a frenzied one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With throbbing heart; and her maids followed her.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But when she reached the tower, amid the throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stood upon the wall, and gazed around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until she saw her Hector dragged along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With foul dishonour by the prancing steeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards the Grecian ships; and, at the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night, as of death, darkened her tearful eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Swooning, she fell, and scattered in her fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ornaments that bound her captive hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wondrous in beauty, band, and wreath, and veil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fillet, Golden Aphrodite’s gift,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_191" id="page_191"></a>{191}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Waited in fear lest she should wake no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But when, at last, the parted life returned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the full sense of misery, she wept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among her kinsfolk, and, with choking sobs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called Hector’s name:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Priam, the King, to the tower where he sat called the beautiful Helen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Hither, my daughter, approach and sit by me here on this tower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence thou mayest see the spouse of thy youth, thy friends and thy kindred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou knowest I never blamed thee; I blame the gods of Olympus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who excited this war of sorrows and tears without number.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, Helen, sit by my side, and tell me the name of yon hero,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mighty and stately in mien. Though others around him are taller,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of such beauty as his and of so majestic a bearing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have never beheld. If he is not a king he is kingly.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_199" id="page_199"></a>{199}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Helen, fairest of women, answered the King: “O my father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father of Paris, by me thou art loved and revered and respected!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would that an evil death had been my lot when I followed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hither thy son, Alexander, leaving my husband behind me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kinsmen, too, and sweet daughter, and friends that I knew since my childhood!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas not allowed me to die&mdash;so I pine away slowly with weeping.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou awaitest reply: thou seest the great Agamemnon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wide-ruling king, as thou saidst, and a warrior valiant and skilful;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once he was a brother to me&mdash;oh, shame!&mdash;in the days that have vanished!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, as a hero a hero, the old man admired Agamemnon:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Happy art thou, Atrides, in birth, and in name, and in fortune;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_200" id="page_200"></a>{200}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many are under thy sway&mdash;the flower of the sons of Achæa.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once into vine-bearing Phrygia I entered, and saw many Phrygians<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Riding swift steeds, the forces of Otreus and Mygdon, the godlike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, with me for an ally, encamped by the banks of the Sangar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting the march of their foes, the Amazons, warrior-women:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But few in number were they to those quick-eyed sons of Achæa.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Next, perceiving Ulysses, the old man said, “My dear Helen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me who this is also&mdash;in stature less than Atrides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less by a head, it may be, but broader in chest and in shoulders.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rest on the ground his arms; but he through the ranks of the army<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ranges about like a ram; to a thick-fleeced ram I compare him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_201" id="page_201"></a>{201}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wandering hither and thither through snow-white sheep in the pasture?”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Him then answered Helen&mdash;Helen of Jove descended:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“That is Ulysses, my father, the wily son of Laertes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nourished in Ithaca’s isle&mdash;Ithaca rocky and barren;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skilled to contrive and complete wise plans and politic counsels.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her then the sage Antenor addressed, when she spake of Ulysses:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Lady, in truth thou hast uttered these words; for once, I remember,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hither the noble Ulysses came with the brave Menelaus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Thou wast the cause of his coming) and I was their host in my palace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of both the heroes I learned the genius and wisdom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they met in the Council, with Trojan heroes assembled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_202" id="page_202"></a>{202}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standing, Ulysses was less by a head than the brave Menelaus&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sitting, more honour was due to the thoughtful brow of Ulysses.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when they wove, for the general ear, their thoughts into language,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Menelaus harangued very freely and briefly, and clearly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never missing his words, nor misapplying their meaning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though, as to years, not yet was he reckoned among the elders.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when Ulysses arose, with his head full of wariest measures,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standing, he fixed his eyes on the ground, and kept looking downwards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moving his sceptre nor backwards nor forwards, but holding it firmly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking like one not wise; and those who beheld him might fancy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he was deeply enraged, and thus bereft of his reason.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when, as I have seen, he sent his great voice from his bosom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_203" id="page_203"></a>{203}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Words that came thick and fast, like the flakes of the snow in the winter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he that listened would say, no man might compete with Ulysse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then we forgot how he looked as the words of Ulysses enchained us.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thirdly, on seeing Ajax, the old King of Helen demanded:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Who, so stately and tall, is this other chief of the Grecians,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rising as high o’er the rest as the height of his head and broad shoulders?”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And thus the comely-robed Helen, the fairest of women, responded:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“He thou beholdest is Ajax, gigantic&mdash;to Grecians a bulwark!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over there, like a god, Idomeneus stands ’mong the Cretans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While around him the chiefs of the Cretan army are gathered.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a time has the brave Menelaus bidden him welcome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_204" id="page_204"></a>{204}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When to our Spartan home he came from the land of the Cretans.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But while I see all around, the rest of the dark-eyed Achæeans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom I well know, and whose names I could tell, two captains I see not&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Castor, tamer of steeds, and Pollux, skilful in boxing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both own brothers of mine: we three were nursed by one mother.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either they have not come with the forces from far Lacedæmon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or having come, it may be, to this place, in sea-traversing vessels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do not desire, after all to enter the battle of heroes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearing the shame and reproach the crime of their sister would cause them.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And sinks it in his heart, and draws it forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And falling, lies at length with upturned face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blood spurts forth, as when a pipe that’s burst<br /></span>

<p>André Chénier, for having dared to write against the excesses of his
countrymen, was summoned before the Revolutional Tribunal, condemned and
executed, in the year 1794. The first eight stanzas (in the translation)
he composed in prison, after his condemnation; the two last he wrote at
the foot of the scaffold, while waiting to be dragged to execution. He
had just finished the line, “Le sommeil du tombeau pressera ma
paupière,” when his turn came, and his words had their fulfillment. In
the translation, the spirit, not the letter, has been regarded.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
